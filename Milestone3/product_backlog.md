# Product Backlog

We're not estimating points for stories yet, and it's a bit too cumbersome to put tasks here so let's wait on writing those.  The product backlog is in priority order with the highest priority at the top.

We will be using <a href="https://pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a> to make this much easier starting with your team project.  But there's nothing magical about using software for this -- co-located teams could use sticky notes on a whiteboard for this.

the site and the features currently available</td>
