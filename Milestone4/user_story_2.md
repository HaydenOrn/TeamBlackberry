## Acceptance Criteria
[Try to write criteria that, when true or satisfied mean that it is correct and you're done. Write them in the "If ___ then ____" format, for if you do this then you should expect this result, for defining the correct behavior that shows the feature works as requested]

1. If I go to /Home/US2, I can see a form that asks for the specified input, and some data from the database is displayed upon receiving a proper query.

2. Search datavase and add relevant content to view.
